This is a group project done by Buse Guldiken, Emmanuel Huff, Jina Lee and myself while studying abroad in the Netherlands. 
Created a terminal-based game in which the user would traverse a dungeon, created by a graph, and encounter monsters to fight. The objective of this project was to reach the end of the dungeon. The user could pick up and use items and also flee attacks if they encounter a monster. 
This project was done in C# on Microsoft Visual Studio where we implemented unit testing for our methods we created. We used this feature to test our block coverage in order to make sure we implemented function calls and other methods properly.
